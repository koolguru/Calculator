-Plan-

Classes
=======
One main form class
One program class
One function class
   - Will contain all math functions that will be used in the event driven architecture of the form
   - constructors not overloaded
   - function parameters will be two doubles

Issues
======
How will the program add more than two numbers
Form design must show all information being processed by the program
