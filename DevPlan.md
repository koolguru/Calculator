Main Development Plan
=====================

This is the general idea of where I want the project to go. If you want to code, please use the Development Plan to keep track of what you are doing.

Classes
=======
- One main form class
- One program class
- One function class
   - Will contain all math functions that will be used in the event driven architecture of the form
   - constructors not overloaded
   - function parameters will be two doubles

Issues
======
- How will the program add more than two numbers
- Form design must show all information being processed by the program 

Progress
========
What I have done so far

- Main form created
- Number buttons added, functional
- Textbox recieving number inputs
- Equals button, non-functional
- About Form (Complete)
   - GitHub Repository link
